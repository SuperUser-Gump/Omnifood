# Omnifood - The Smart 365-Days-Per-Year Food Subscription

This project is part of the [Build Responsive Real-World Websites with HTML and CSS](https://www.udemy.com/course/design-and-develop-a-killer-website-with-html5-and-css3/) course by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://github.com/jonasschmedtmann). The website design and structure were provided as part of the course curriculum, and I did not design the website from scratch. The project's primary purpose is to practice and apply the concepts learned during the course.

## Live Demo

Check out the live demo of the project [here](https://superuser-gump.github.io/Omnifood/).

## Description

In this project, we introduce "Omnifood," a tech company prioritizing users' well-being through convenient and healthy eating. Busy lifestyles often lead to unhealthy diets, and we aim to remedy this with AI-driven meal planning. Our app lets users customize weekly meal plans, which our AI algorithm creates. We go the extra mile by partnering with restaurants to prepare and deliver these meals in select cities, all within a monthly subscription. Users can choose one or two meals per day, every day of the month.

This project showcases the Omnifood website, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with a focus on modern web design principles to improve the user experience.
